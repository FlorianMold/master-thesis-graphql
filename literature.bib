  abstract   = {{GraphQL} is a novel query language proposed by Facebook to implement Web-based {APIs}. In this paper, we present a practical study on migrating {API} clients to this new technology. First, we conduct a grey literature review to gain an in-depth understanding on the beneﬁts and key characteristics normally associated to {GraphQL} by practitioners. After that, we assess such beneﬁts in practice, by migrating seven systems to use {GraphQL}, instead of standard {REST}-based {APIs}. As our key result, we show that {GraphQL} can reduce the size of the {JSON} documents returned by {REST} {APIs} in 94\% (in number of ﬁelds) and in 99\% (in number of bytes), both median results.},

\section{Implemente a micro-frontend prototype}\label{section:applied-methods:prototypical-implementation}

The first step was to implement a prototypical micro-frontend application to evaluate the hypothesis. The base architecture was developed to lay the groundwork for later use in a production environment. The micro-frontends are integrated using client-side integration, more precisely, run-time integration. The integration strategy was implemented with Webpack's Module Federation, which was described in more detail in Section \ref{subsection:background:micro-frontend:module-federation}. The majority of the implementation is written in Angular. One micro-frontend was implemented in React to showcase the technology agnosticism of the caching strategy. The prototype contains an application shell that consumes the other micro-frontends. The architecture is divided into nine widgets that display only simple data and four complex 
\acp{SPA}. The four \acp{SPA} are Dashboard, Contact, Sales, and User.

\bigskip

\noindent The library Nx\footnote{\url{https://github.com/nrwl/nx}} from the company Nwrl is used for managing the micro-frontends and libraries in a single monorepo. An essential feature of Nx is the support for monorepos, which is the perfect match for managing micro-frontend applications. It offers support and tooling for almost any \ac{JS} framework and can be customized with plugins. Multiple related projects can be managed in a single workspace. Additionally, it ensures that every project uses the same version of a dependency across the workspace. Besides, Nx offers helper functions for working with Module Federation in micro-frontends. \cite{misc:-:applied-methods:intro-to-nx}

\bigskip

\noindent A rough overview of the architecture is shown in Figure \ref{fig:applied-methods:prototype-micro-frontend-architecture}. It shows a wireframe of the structure of the application. The icons inside the squares represent the \ac{JS} framework used. Each widget is a separate micro-frontend that exposes a module through Module Federation, which is then consumed by the Dashboard micro-frontend.

\noindent Each micro-frontend is deployed separately and is accessible by a separate \ac{URL}. The application shell is the entry point for the client, and it consumes the Dashboard, Contact, Sales, and User application. The main functionality of the micro-frontends is encapsulated in modules. These modules of the applications can be easily accessed through the Module Federation and used by the application shell. The modules are used in exactly the same way in the standalone application.

\bigskip

\noindent Listing \ref{code:applied-methods:module-federation-config-expose} shows the configuration of the contact micro-frontend to expose its primary implementation through Module Federation in the form of the \texttt{entry.module}. The configuration of the other micro-frontends looks similar. The properties of the module-federation plugin were already discussed in Section \ref{subsection:background:micro-frontend:module-federation}. All Angular- and Apollo- dependencies are specified to be shared across all micro-frontends. Sharing the dependencies ensures that all micro-frontends use the same and only one version of the dependencies. Listing \ref{code:applied-methods:module-federation-config-expose}, the versions of the dependencies are explicitly specified. Inside the prototype, the versions are read from the root \texttt{package.json} to ensure consistency with the installed versions.

module.exports = {
  name: 'contact',
  exposes: {
    './Module': 'apps/contact/src/app/remote-entry/entry.module.ts',
  },

    '@angular/core': {
      singleton: true, strictVersion: true, requiredVersion: '^15.1.1' 
    },

\noindent The application shell is configured to consume the modules listed inside the \texttt{remotes}-object. The configuration to consume the four micro-frontends of the architecture can be seen in the Listing \ref{code:applied-methods:module-federation-config-consume}. This configuration allows the application shell to consume the \texttt{entry.module} of the micro-frontends, which were exposed before with the configuration from Listing \ref{code:applied-methods:module-federation-config-expose}. The application shell shares the same dependencies as the micro-frontends. Dependency sharing is required so that micro-frontends can load their runtime dependencies from the application shell and use the same dependency version.

module.exports = {
  name: 'host',
  remotes: {
    contact: 'contact@http://localhost:4201/remoteEntry.js'
    sales: 'sales@http://localhost:4202/remoteEntry.js'
    dashboard: 'dashboard@http://localhost:4203/remoteEntry.js'
    user: 'user@http://localhost:4204/remoteEntry.js'
  },
  shared: {
    '@angular/core': {
      singleton: true, strictVersion: true, requiredVersion: '^15.1.1' 
    },
    ...
    'apollo-angular': { 
      singleton: true, strictVersion: true, requiredVersion: '^4.0.1'

};

\noindent Using the Module Federation configuration from Listing \ref{code:applied-methods:module-federation-config-consume}, the application shell can load and render the micro-frontends. Listing \ref{code:applied-methods:angular-route-to-remote-module} shows the route configuration for displaying the contact micro-frontend using Angular's router. Nx offers helper functions like \texttt{loadRemoteModule} for Module Federation to load micro-frontends into a route of the application shell. The application shell follows the approach of showing one micro-frontend per route. The dashboard on the other hand displays multiple micro-frontend widgets on a page.

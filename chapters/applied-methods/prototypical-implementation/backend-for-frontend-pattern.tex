\subsection{Backend for frontend architecture}

The backend-for-frontend pattern was implemented using a GraphQL API, and Apollo Server was chosen to implement the API for the micro-frontends. All micro-frontends use the same GraphQL endpoint to fetch their data. However, multiple endpoints could also be used. The GraphQL API communicates with the cluster of microservices and aggregates the results to be used for the micro-frontends. When creating the GraphQL API, the microservice was still under development, but the data structures for the databases were already finalized. Many mock-dataset were generated for the schemas and used for implementing the GraphQL API. The queries and mutations were implemented by directly reading and writing the mock data. The API will be changed to directly communicate with the microservices inside the company's cluster.

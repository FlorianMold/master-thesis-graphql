\subsection{Challenges with secondary entry points}\label{subsection:applied-methods:prototypical-implementation:sharing
-secondary-entrypoints}

By default, all micro-frontend dependencies are shared through Module Federation. The required configuration options for every dependency in the micro-frontend architecture are \texttt{singleton}, \texttt{strictVersion}, and \texttt{requiredVersion}. These options are explained in more detail in Section \ref{subsection:background:micro-frontend:module-federation}. The versions of the dependencies are determined automatically from the \texttt{package.json}. However, some packages have issues being shared with these settings. The dependency \texttt{@apollo/client} is problematic because it has secondary entry points. When attempting to share \texttt{@apollo/client/core}, \texttt{@apollo/client/link/batch} and \texttt{@apollo/client/link/error} the warning message in Figure \ref{fig:applied-methods:sharing-secondary-entrypoints-error} is shown.

\noindent The root of the problems are the secondary entry points like \texttt{@apollo/client/core}, which are like an \ac{NPM} package inside another \ac{NPM} package. The content of the \texttt{package.json} from \texttt{@apollo/client/core} is shown in Listing \ref{code:applied-methods:package-json-apollo-client-core}. Webpack tries to resolve the version of the secondary entry point from that \texttt{package.json} and not from \texttt{@apollo/client}. The version is missing inside the file, so Webpack cannot determine the version and prints the warning message shown in Figure \ref{fig:applied-methods:sharing-secondary-entrypoints-error}. The warning does not lead to an error in production, but the dependencies cannot be shared and are included in every micro-frontend bundle.

\noindent The warning was fixed by specifying the version for these packages manually. The version is the same as that of \texttt{@apollo/client}. The configuration for sharing these packages is shown in the Listing \ref{code:applied-methods:sharing-secondary-entrypoints-config}. Every time a package starts with \texttt{@apollo/client/} the version is set to \texttt{3.6.9}. This version is the same as the version of \texttt{@apollo/client}.

  return defaultConfig;
}

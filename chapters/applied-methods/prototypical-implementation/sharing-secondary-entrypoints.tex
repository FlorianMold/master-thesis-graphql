\subsection{Sharing secondary entry points}\label{subsection:applied-methods:prototypical-implementation:sharing
-secondary-entrypoints}

By default, all dependencies of the micro-frontends are shared through Module Federation. The configuration options for every dependency are \texttt{singleton}-, \texttt{strictVersion}-, and \texttt{requiredVersion}-property. These properties are explained in more detail in Section \ref{subsection:background:micro-frontend:module-federation}. The versions of these dependencies are determined automatically from the \texttt{package.json}. However, not all packages support being shared with these default settings. The npm package \texttt{@apollo/client} has a problem because it has secondary entry points. When trying to share \texttt{@apollo/client/core}, \texttt{@apollo/client/link/batch} and \texttt{@apollo/client/link/error} the error message in Figure \ref{fig:applied-methods:sharing-secondary-entrypoints-error} is shown.

\noindent The problems are secondary entry points like \texttt{@apollo/client/core}, which are a bit like an npm package in another npm package. The \texttt{package.json} of \texttt{@apollo/client/core} is shown in Listing \ref{code:applied-methods:package-json-apollo-client-core}. Webpack tries to resolve the version of the secondary entry point from the \texttt{package.json} and not from \texttt{@apollo/client}. Therefore, it cannot determine the version and prints the warning shown in Figure \ref{fig:applied-methods:sharing-secondary-entrypoints-error}. The warning does not lead to an error, but these dependencies cannot be shared and must be included in every micro-frontend bundle.

\noindent The Module Federation was fixed by specifying the version for these packages manually. The version is the same as that of \texttt{@apollo/client}. The configuration for the sharing of these packages is shown in the Listing \ref{code:applied-methods:sharing-secondary-entrypoints-config}.

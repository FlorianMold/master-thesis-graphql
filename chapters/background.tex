\chapter{Background}\label{chapter:background}

This chapter will give insights into the most important topics and technologies relevant to this thesis. In the beginning, the topic of software monoliths is briefly introduced. The following section is about the abstraction of APIs focusing on backend-for-frontends. Afterwards, the micro-frontend architecture is described with its characteristics, advantages, and disadvantages. The section explains different integration strategies as well as communication patterns. The section also goes into the topic of Generic APIs vs. Consumer Driven APIs. Next, a brief overview of GraphQL's characteristics, advantages, and disadvantages is given. The section also describes implementations of GraphQL specification in the form of Apollo Server and Apollo Client. Particular importance is attached to explaining how the Apollo Client's in-memory cache works. The chapter closes with a short description of the theory and how the reduction of GraphQL queries with a caching mechanism works in theory.

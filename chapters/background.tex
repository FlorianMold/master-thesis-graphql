\section{Micro-Frontend Architecture}

Micro-frontends try to apply the same principles from the microservice architecture to frontend development. Often times a microservice architecture with is developed by several teams has only one frontend application. Therefore, when adding new features a single team can be overwhelmed. Like a microservice architecture, a micro-frontend architecture focuses on developing many small frontend-applications, instead of developing a large software monolith. Each micro-frontend can be developed independently by another team. But a challenge is that the micro-frontend should appear as a single application to the user. Therefore, the different applications have to be integrated, which can be a challenge.

The term micro-frontend should not lead to false conclusions about the size of an application. The size of micro-frontends can vary. It can range from a simple login to a complex single-page application.

Building micro-frontends with the web allows different strategies of integrating the applications. Three different strategies exist to combine multiple micro-frontends into an app-shell. The client-side integration, the server-side integration and the combination of these two strategies and the combination of both strategies.



\subsection{Characteristics}

Micro-frontends tend to follow the same characteristics as microservices.

\subsubsection{Autonomous}

Technically a micro-frontend is a completely independent and runnable application.
The integration of the micro-frontends happens only through the frontend. The different micro-frontends are composed withing an app-shell. The application shell is a separete application that is usually the entry-point for the user to interact with all micro-frontends. The app-shell also provides the layout of the page and defines where the micro-frontends are placed.

\subsubsection{Technology Agnostic}

Just as microservices architectures, micro-frontend architectures can be technology agnostic. The current frontend development landscape offers a lot of JavaScript frameworks to choose from.

\subsubsection{Independently Depoyable}

The autonomy of micro-frontends offer the possibility for independent deployments. A large monolithical micro-frontends is trickier to deploy. There is no need to have communication over multiple teams to deploy the application.

\section{GraphQL}

The officical documentation states that GraphQL is a query language for APIs and a runtime for fulfilling those queries with your existing data. GraphQL provides a complete and understandable description of the data in your API, gives clients the power to ask for exactly what they need and nothing more, makes it easier to evolve APIs over time, and enables powerful developer tools. GraphQL is implemented in many languages and frameworks. It has a large ecosystem of libraries and tools.

\subsection{Origins and history}

GraphQL was initially developed at Facebook in 2012. In 2015 the project was made open-source and available to the public. The motivation behind the initial development of GraphQL was the limited flexibility of available API technologies like REST.

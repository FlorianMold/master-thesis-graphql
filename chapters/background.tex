\chapter{Background}

This chapter will give insights into the most important topics and technologies relevant for this thesis. At the beginning, the topic of software monoliths is briefly introduced. The following section is about the abstraction of APIs with the focus on backend-for-frontends. Afterwards the micro-frontend architecture is described with its characteristics and advantages and disadvantages. The section explains different integration strategies as well as the communication patterns. The section also goes in the topic of Generic APIs vs Consumer Driven APIs. This leads to a brief overview of GraphQL with it's characteristics and advantages and disadvantages. The section also describes implementations of GraphQL specification in the form of Apollo Server and Apollo Client. Special importance is attached to explaining the way the Apollo Client's in-memory cache works. The chapter closes with a short description of the theory, how the reduction of GraphQL queries with a caching mechanism works in theory.

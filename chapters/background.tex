\chapter{Background}\label{chapter:background}

This chapter will give insights into the most important topics and technologies relevant to this thesis. At the beginning, the topic of software monoliths is briefly introduced. The following section is about the abstraction of \acp{API} focusing on \acp{BFF}. Afterwards, the micro-frontend architecture is described with its characteristics, advantages, and disadvantages. Then the section explains different integration strategies as well as communication patterns. The section also goes into the topic of Generic \acp{API} vs. Consumer Driven \acp{API}. Next, a brief overview of GraphQL's characteristics, advantages, and disadvantages is given. Then the section describes implementations of GraphQL specification in the form of Apollo Server and Apollo Client. Particular importance is attached to explaining how the Apollo Client's in-memory cache works. In the end, the chapter briefly describes how removing fields from a GraphQL query with a caching mechanism could work in theory.

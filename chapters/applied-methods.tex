\chapter{Applied Methods}\label{chapter:applied-methods}

This chapter documents how the prototype micro-frontend architecture was built step by step. It starts with building the foundation of the application, continues with building the communication between the shell and remote application. Then, with the common caching layer and the reduction of queries, the basis for the evaluation of the hypothesis of the work was established. The final section is a comparison between the original and reduced queries.

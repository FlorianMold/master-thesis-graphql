\chapter{Applied Methods}\label{chapter:applied-methods}

This chapter documents how the prototypical micro-frontend architecture was built step by step. The first section centers around identifying bounded contexts and deriving the micro-frontends from them. The following section is about the prototypical implementation of the micro-frontend architecture. After implementing the architecture, the communication patterns between the micro-frontends were analyzed and implemented. The next section is about developing the shared caching layer. The last section centers around the mechanism to remove fields from a GraphQL query by utilizing the Apollo Client's in-memory cache. This chapter ends by showing an example of how the query reduction works in practice.

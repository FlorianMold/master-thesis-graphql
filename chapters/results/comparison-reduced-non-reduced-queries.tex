\subsection{Comparison between queries and reduced queries}

This section shows the difference in request- and response size of different queries. The table \ref{table:code:comparison-user-reduction} shows the difference in the size of the user-detail query, with the query reduction that was explained in the previous section. By removing 8 fields from the request, the size of the requests were reduced by 30\% or by 161 bytes. When querying 10 users a total of 1.61 KB can be saved. The response size is reduced by 42\% on average. 2.55 KB in response size is saved if 10 users are queried.

\noindent Table \ref{table:code:comparison-contract-reduction} shows the difference for the contract-detail query. By running the list query for all contracts 10 fields from the 17 can be removed from the query. Therefore only 7 of the 17 fields are remaining inside the query. The requests can be reduced by an average of 38\% or by 207 bytes. When using the application and querying 10 detailed views of the contract 2.07 KB can be saved. The size of the response from the GraphQL backend can be reduced by about 58\%. 3.96 KB in response size is saved if 10 contracts are queried.

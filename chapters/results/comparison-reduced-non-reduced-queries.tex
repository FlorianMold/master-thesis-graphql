\section{Comparison between queries and reduced queries}

This section looks at the difference between the original and reduced queries' request- and response sizes. The Table \ref{table:code:comparison-user-reduction} shows the difference in the size of the user-detail query between the original and reduced queries. The fields of the user-detail query and the removed fields are explained in more detail in Section \ref{subsection:background:graphql:example-reduction}.
The field size of the GraphQL query was reduced by half. By removing 8 fields from the original GraphQL query, the size of the network requests to the GraphQL \ac{API} was reduced by about 30\% or by 161 bytes. When retrieving 10 users, a total of 1.61 KB can be saved. The response size was reduced by 42\% on average. A 2.55 KB response size is saved if 10 users are fetched from the GraphQL \ac{API}.

\noindent Table \ref{table:code:comparison-contract-reduction} shows the difference between original and reduced queries for the contract-detail query. The query fetches the data to display a list of all contracts. By running the query for all contracts 10 fields from the 17 fields are removed from the query. Herefore, only 7 of the 17 fields remain inside the query because 58\% were removed. The network requests to the GraphQL \ac{API} can be reduced by an average of 38\% or 207 bytes. Using the application and querying 10 detail views of a contract 2.07 KB of request size can be saved. The response size from the GraphQL \ac{API} can be reduced by about 58\% or 3.96 KB.

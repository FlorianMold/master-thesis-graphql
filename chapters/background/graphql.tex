\section{GraphQL}

GraphQL was developed by Facebook and refers to itself as the query language for an API. It provides the client with the opportunity to ask exactly for the data is needed. GraphQL offers the advantage that all data must be loaded from only one URL. With the help of the types within the GraphQL schema, the technology offers an understandable description of the
API for clients. \cite{misc:-:graphql-org} The functionality of GraphQL on the frontend can be compared to SQL on the database level. The client writes its queries with the desired fields from a dataset.

The official documentation states that GraphQL is a query language for APIs and a runtime for fulfilling those queries with your existing data. GraphQL provides a complete and understandable description of the data in your API, gives clients the power to ask for exactly what they need and nothing more, makes it easier to evolve APIs over time, and enables powerful developer tools. GraphQL is implemented in many languages and frameworks. It has a large ecosystem of libraries and tools.

\subsection{Origins and history}

GraphQL was initially developed at Facebook in 2012. In 2015 the project was made open-source and available to the public. The motivation behind the initial development of GraphQL was the limited flexibility of available API technologies like REST.

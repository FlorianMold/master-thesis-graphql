\section{Micro-Frontend Architecture}\label{section:background:micro-frontend-architecture}

Micro-frontends should bring the same advantages of microservices to the frontend. Instead of creating a giant frontend monolith, a micro-frontend architecture contains many small applications. The advantage is that a separate team can develop and deploy every micro-frontend independently. \cite{book:2020:geers:background:micro-frontends:micro-frontends-in-action} The difference between monolithic frontend architecture and micro-frontend architecture can be seen in Figure \ref{fig:background:micro-frontend:monolith-micro-frontend-comparison}. In a micro-frontend architecture, each team creates their application and implements every layer vertically. The teams can choose their technology stack and are not bound to the technology stack of the other teams.

\noindent Benefits gained from using microservices are lost when having a monolithic frontend architecture. With a monolithic frontend, the ability to make independent deployments of new features for a microservice is lost. The entire frontend has to be deployed as a single unit. Another problem is that distinct operations are not possible. If one section of the frontend is broken, there is a good chance that the entire frontend will not work. Another difficulty is the parallel and autonomous development of the application. The development speed cannot be increased because having multiple teams working simultaneously on one frontend application is very challenging. \cite{misc:2019:leitner:background:micro-frontends:micro-frontends-basics}

\bigskip

\noindent The term micro-frontend can be misleading, as can the term microservice. It has no meaning in terms of the size of the application, and it can be a simple widget that only displays data or a full-blown single-page application. Ideally, a micro-frontend covers an area of the entire frontend application.

\bigskip

\noindent Micro-frontends try to apply the same principles from microservice architectures to modern web development. Often a microservice architecture developed by several teams has only a single frontend monolith. Therefore, when adding new features, a single team can be overwhelmed. Like a microservice architecture, a micro-frontend architecture focuses on developing many small frontend applications instead of developing a giant software monolith. Each micro-frontend can be developed independently by different teams. However, a challenge is that micro-frontend architecture should be presented as a single coherent application to the user. Therefore, the different micro-frontend must be integrated to be able to interact with each other, which can present a challenge.

\bigskip

\noindent Building micro-frontends with web technologies allows different strategies for integrating the applications. Three strategies exist to combine multiple micro-frontends into an application shell: client-side integration, server-side integration, and a combination of both strategies. \cite[10-12]{book:2020:geers:background:micro-frontends:micro-frontends-in-action}

\subsection{Characteristics}\label{subsection:background:micro-frontend-characteristics}

Micro-frontends follow the same characteristics as microservices, described in more detail in this chapter. Each characteristic gets a short description of how it applies to micro-frontends.

\subsubsection{Autonomous}\label{subsubsection:background:micro-frontend-autonomous}

Technically a micro-frontend is an entirely independent and runnable application. The integration of the micro-frontends happens only through the frontend. The different micro-frontends are combined within an application shell. The application shell is a separate application that is usually the entry point for the client to interact with all micro-frontends. The application shell also provides the page layout and defines where the micro-frontends are displayed. Autonomy should not go in the direction of complete isolation. Nevertheless, no dependencies should emerge, which could harm autonomy. \cite{book:2020:geers:background:micro-frontends:micro-frontends-in-action}

\subsubsection{Technology Agnostic}\label{subsubsection:background:micro-frontend-technology-agnostic}

Just as microservice architectures, micro-frontend architectures can be technology agnostic. The current frontend development landscape offers a lot of \ac{JS} frameworks, which have different advantages and disadvantages. The advantage of having an application with small independent building blocks is that parts can be written with another technology more easily. \cite[14-16]{book:2020:geers:background:micro-frontends:micro-frontends-in-action} However, using different technologies for different micro-frontends can lead to problems with the chosen form of integration and communication. The communication should also be technology agnostic and use browser-native tools like Broadcast Channel \ac{API}.

\bigskip

\noindent Another problem that could arise is the bundle size of modern \ac{JS} frameworks. If two frameworks like React and Angular need to be fetched alongside each other, the total bundle size can be enormous and a strain for (mobile) network connections. Loading and running multiple micro-frontends is also resource intensive for the browser. Micro-frontends can be developed using a standardized \ac{API} like Web Components. With this approach, no specific framework is needed for developing an application. \cite{book:2020:geers:background:micro-frontends:micro-frontends-in-action}

\subsubsection{Independently Deployable}\label{subsubsection:background:micro-frontend-independent-deployable}

The autonomy of micro-frontends offers the possibility for independent deployments. A sizeable monolithic frontend application is complex to deploy, and there is less to no need for communication and coordination over multiple teams to deploy the application. Organizational dependencies negatively impact the time-to-market because development teams might have to wait for another team's release to be able to ship their software. \cite[12]{book:2020:geers:background:micro-frontends:micro-frontends-in-action}

\subsubsection{Small and Easy to Maintain}\label{subsubsection:background:micro-frontend-small-and-easy-to-maintain}

Because micro-frontends only contain a small oart of the full functionality of an application, the source code is smaller and easier to understand. A smaller codebase is especially helpful for understanding the inner workings of the software. Onboarding new team members is also more accessible because the codebase is smaller than software monoliths. Due to the easier understanding of the domain, the application can be easier rewritten with state-of-the-art technology if the old one becomes deprecated. \cite{book:2020:geers:background:micro-frontends:micro-frontends-in-action}

\subsubsection{Resilience}\label{subsubsection:background:micro-frontend-resilience}

Micro-frontends offer the possibility of building a single application by composing multiple independent small applications into a fully-fledged frontend. Depending on the integration strategy, micro-frontends are usually combined at runtime. However, the network, especially for mobile devices fails sometimes. A micro-frontend architecture provides better failure isolation. One micro-frontend failing does not affect the other micro-frontends inside the architecture. Some parts of the application might not work, but other parts of the micro-frontend architecture are still usable. The application shell can react to a failure and tell the clients that a small part of the app is not working as expected and will be available again shortly. \cite[10-11]{article:2021:perltonen:background:micro-frontends:motivations-benefits-and-issues}

\subsection{Disadvantages}\label{subsection:background:micro-frontend-downsides}

Building micro-frontends comes with many advantages but also with some downsides. The following section describes a few disadvantages of micro-frontends. The autonomy of having independent teams that build autonomous software comes with a price. A critical aspect of building software is eliminating redundancy in the code, and having multiple teams that build and run applications side-by-side might introduce much redundancy in the form of duplicate code. This can include duplicate styles and components, that should normally be handled with a component library. Every team must set up its build process and a continuous integration pipeline. If the \ac{BFF} pattern is used, the number of services to deploy doubles, significantly increasing infrastructure complexity. If multiple teams use a popular library and a critical security vulnerability is encountered, every team must update the dependency and deploy a new version of the application to fix the problem. It is essential to share knowledge between the teams to avoid fixing the same bugs repeatedly. The cost of having redundancies is lower than the negative impacts of having inter-team dependencies. The free choice of technology also comes with some disadvantages. It is hard for a developer to switch from one team to another or exchange best practices for development. Like in distributed systems, keeping backward compatibility between the different micro-frontends takes a lot of effort and planning. Different micro-frontends might have different dependencies, versions, and interfaces.  \cite[17-18]{book:2020:geers:background:micro-frontends:micro-frontends-in-action} One of the main concerns is payload size, as independently-built JavaScript bundles can cause duplication of common dependencies, increasing the number of bytes sent over the network to end users. Additionally, maintaining consistency in user experience and visual design across different micro-frontends can take time, especially when developed by different teams or with technologies. Maintaining a consistent look and feel across different components using a design system can require additional effort and coordination. \cite{misc:2019:jackson:background:micro-frontends:disadvantages} Another problem addressed in this master thesis is the problem of over-requesting, where a micro-frontend might need to make more requests to fetch the desired data, while another might need precisely that data. Over-fetching might also be a problem, where a micro-frontend fetches more data than is required for the page. A problem specific to micro-frontends is that they might make the same network requests to the \ac{BFF}, leading to a higher server load. Because every micro-frontend is a separate application, all of them might query the authenticated user.

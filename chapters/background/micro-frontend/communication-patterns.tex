\subsection{Communication between Micro frontends}

Micro-frontends should not depend on each other. But often it is necessary have communication between them. For example if a user adds an item to the shopping-cart. The product micro-frontend has to inform the shopping-cart micro-frontend with the item that was added. The reduce the coupling between applications and development teams it is recommended to keep the communication at a minimum.

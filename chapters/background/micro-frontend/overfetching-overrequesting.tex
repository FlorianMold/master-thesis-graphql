\subsection{Generic APIs vs Consumer Driven APIs}\label{subsection:background:micro-frontend:generic-vs-consumer-driven-apis}

The big decision in micro-frontend \ac{API} development is to use either generic or consumer-oriented \acp{API}. The difference is that generic \acp{API} emphasize reusability, while consumer-oriented \acp{API} tailor the \acp{API} to the consumer.

\subsubsection{Generic \acp{API}}\label{subsubsection:background:micro-frontend:generic-vs-consumer-driven-apis:generic-apis}

Generic \acp{API} refer to \acp{API} that are very generic and can be used by multiple consumers. However, this type of \ac{API} has two significant drawbacks. Over-fetching describes the problem of getting more data than is needed, and Over-requesting describes the problem of needing multiple requests to get the data for a use case. Both problems are discussed in more detail in the following paragraphs. \cite{misc:2019:leitner:background:micro-frontends:backend-for-frontends}

\paragraph{Over-Fetching}\label{paragraph:background:micro-frontend:generic-vs-consumer-driven-apis:generic-apis:over-fetching}

For example, a contact service provides a contact model that includes \texttt{customerNumber}, \texttt{firstName}, \texttt{secondName}, \texttt{uidNumber}, and the user's address, as seen in the Listing \ref{code:background:micro-frontends:over-fetching}. However, one application requirement is to display only a contact's first and last name inside the header. Only two fields of the model are used, and the rest are unnecessarily queried. \cite{misc:2019:leitner:background:micro-frontends:backend-for-frontends}

\ifshowListings
\begin{listing}[H]
  \begin{minted}{typescript}
interface ContactModel {
  id: string;
  customerNumber: string;
  firstName: string;
  secondName: string;
  uidNumber: string;

  Address: {
    id: string;
    postalCode: string;
    location: string;
    Country: string;
  }
}
  \end{minted}
  \caption{Contact-Model that contains too many fields for a use-case.}\label{code:background:micro-frontends:over-fetching}
\end{listing}
\fi

\paragraph{Over-Requesting}\label{paragraph:background:micro-frontend:generic-vs-consumer-driven-apis:generic-apis:over-requesting}

Attempting to solve the problem of over-fetching by reducing the number of fields that are returned leads directly to over-requesting. Listing \ref{code:background:micro-frontends:over-requesting} shows an example of over-requesting. If a use-case inside the application should display the address alongside the contact, two requests have to be performed every time to aggregate the necessary data. Afterwards, the two data sets have to be merged, leading to high program complexity on the client. \cite{misc:2019:leitner:background:micro-frontends:backend-for-frontends}

\ifshowListings
\begin{listing}[H]
  \begin{minted}{typescript}
interface ContactModel {
  id: string;
  customerNumber: string;
  firstName: string;
  secondName: string;
  uidNumber: string;

  address_id: string;
}
  \end{minted}
  \caption{Contact-Model model that links to the address-model with the address id.}\label{code:background:micro-frontends:over-requesting}
\end{listing}
\fi

\subsubsection{Consumer Driven \acp{API}}\label{subsubection:background:micro-frontend:generic-vs-consumer-driven-apis:consumer-driven-apis}

Consumer-driven \acp{API} are the opposite of generic \acp{API}. They follow the idea of providing the client with exactly the data it needs. Following the example above, the contact service would have an endpoint that returns only the first name and last name as required for the use-case. These endpoints make communication with a client straightforward, and there is no problem of over-fetching and over-requesting. However, creating an endpoint for each use-case creates an unmanageable set of endpoints. \cite{misc:2019:leitner:background:micro-frontends:backend-for-frontends} To solve the problems of over-fetching and over-requesting, the \ac{BFF} pattern is frequently used. This pattern provides each client with their own \ac{API}, which is adapted to their needs. \cite{book:2018:richardson:background:bff:microservices-patterns}

\noindent Figure \ref{fig:background:micro-frontend:bff-architecture} shows an exemplary micro-frontend architecture using the \ac{BFF} pattern. Each frontend has a \ac{BFF} service that fetches data only for that specific client. Because the \acp{BFF} work as a gateway to the domain services, the domain services can stay very generic and be reused by a variety of different clients. \acp{BFF} should implement only the presentation logic that transforms the data into the form that the client required, and it should avoid storing state. \cite{misc:2019:leitner:background:micro-frontends:backend-for-frontends}
\bigskip

\noindent The \ac{BFF} and the frontend application form a single deployment unit when this architectural approach is used. If one service changes, the other must adapt to the changes. GraphQL is a perfect technology for implementing a \ac{BFF} because it is specifically designed for implementing the presentation layer.
